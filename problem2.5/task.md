## Task
Create a currency swap form based on the template provided in the folder. A user would use this form to swap assets from one currency to another.

*You may use any third party plugin, library, and/or framework for this problem.*

1. You may add input validation/error messages to make the form interactive.
2. Your submission will be rated on its usage intuitiveness and visual attractiveness.
3. Show us your frontend development and design skills, feel free to totally disregard the provided files for this problem.
4. You can use @/utils/constants.ts to get the token icons and prices.
5. You may use this [URL](https://interview.switcheo.com/prices.json) for token price information and to compute exchange rates (not every token has a price, those that do not can be omitted).

Hint: feel free to simulate or mock interactions with a backend service, e.g. implement a loading indicator with a timeout delay for the submit button is good enough.
